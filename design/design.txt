Propninja
	A simple Mac OS X application for working with java properties files

Goal
	View properties
		An interface for looking up properties
	Edit properties
		An interface for modifying properties
	Intuitive
		Use the least amount of clicks/interactions to do what's needed
		Searching should be easy but powerful
	Simple conveniences
		Simplify slightly more advanced tasks such as history navigation

Technical Design
	Front-End
		Mac OS Cocoa Application
	Back-End
		Mac OS Cocoa Application
			Starting the subprocess every single session vs having a long lived subprocess?
				Starting new one every single session *
					Pros
						Less memory leak possibility
						Less management for subprocess (start/run/kill)
					Cons
						Overhead of starting a new subprocess every single session

					Index
					Search
					Edit
				Keeping one running
					Pros
						Less overhead with starting new subprocesses every single session
					Cons
						More likely to lead to memory leak issue (is this an unnecessary concern though?)
		Python Indexing Service
		Python Beautiful Properties Library
			Read properties
				Retain formatting while reading
			Testing
				Properties
					Correctness
						Given a random properties file, compare the injested properties with known good source
							Random properties file
								Generated by test generator
								Need to supply edge cases (no properties, duplicate properties)
							Known good source
								Supplied by test generator - how do we know the test generator is doing the right thing?
									We'd have to just trust it :D

				Formatting
					Correctness
				Performance
					vs Java ?
	Communication
		Sockets (deprecated)
		Standard input/output (pipe)
		Other pipes?
